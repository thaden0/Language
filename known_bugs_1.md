# Known bugs — part 1 of 2 (known_bugs_1.md)

Active, unresolved bugs only. This is one half of the known-bug register;
the other half lives in `known_bugs_2.md`. The two files together hold every open
entry, with high- and low-priority bugs dispersed evenly across both so
neither file skews toward one tier. Bug numbers are the stable identity —
a `#N` cross-reference may point at an entry in the companion file.

Each entry has a minimal repro, expected vs. actual behavior, and a
root-cause pointer. Fixed bugs are not tracked here — see git history
(commits prefixed `bug.md #N`) for their resolutions.

Every entry carries a priority tag (`[P0]`–`[P3]`) in its heading, assigned
by the marker checklist in **Priority system** below, plus a one-line
justification citing the exact marker(s) so the assignment is auditable.

Current standings for this file (within a tier, ordered by bug number):

| Priority | Bugs |
|----------|---------------|
| P0       | #95 |
| P1       | — |
| P2       | — |
| P3       | — |

Each entry's Workaround note (inline, above) carries its own debt sites — there is no
separate `docs/footguns.md` registry (retired 2026-07-19, merged into these two files).
Once the composition corpus lands, a fixed bug also gets a red-lane repro promoted to
green under `tests/corpus/composition/` (`designs/techdesign-composition-corpus.md`).
Fixing #N means: fix, delete the entry here, promote red→green — one commit.

## Priority system

Priorities are derived mechanically from the markers below so that different
agents assign the same tier to the same facts. Evaluate tiers top-down
(P0 → P3) and assign the first tier with at least one matching marker. Two
overrides, applied in this order:

1. **Explicit owner ruling wins.** If the entry records an owner ruling that
   names a priority ("low priority for now", "treat as P0", ...), use that
   priority regardless of markers, and cite the ruling.
2. **Semantics-ruling cap.** If the intended *observable behavior* is still
   undecided — the owner must choose what programs should see before any fix
   can be written — cap the priority at P2 unless a P0 marker applies. A
   pending ruling that concerns only fix *shape or ownership* (the intended
   behavior is undisputed) does not cap.

Definitions used by the markers: the **oracle** is `--run` (`Eval.cpp`), the
ground truth `.expected` files are generated from
(`designs/complete/techdesign-portable-backend.md` §0.4). **Actively-maintained engines**
are `--ir`, emit-C++ (`--build`), and LLVM (`--build-native`); LLVM is the
primary backend (portable pivot, 2026-07-05). **Frozen** means
`X64Gen.cpp`/ELF (`--emit-elf`). **Ordinary user code** means expressible in
a plain `.lev` source file without editing the compiler or the prelude.

### P0 — critical
- **P0.1** The oracle prints wrong output for ordinary user code — wrong per
  the language reference, or unanimously contradicted by the
  actively-maintained engines. (Risk: the wrong output gets baked into
  `.expected` files and the correct engines then read as regressed.)
- **P0.2** A track is blocked right now and no workaround lets it proceed.
- **P0.3** An actively-maintained engine exhibits **silent state corruption**
  for ordinary, checker-accepted code: memory corruption, data going stale
  after unrelated activity, or an operation silently dropped — any failure
  whose symptom surfaces *away from the causing site*. Distinguished from
  P1.1 (a wrong value observed at the faulting expression itself): a P0.3
  defect's blast radius is unbounded, it mis-attributes downstream debugging
  time, and a crash-later variant counts even though the exit is nonzero.
  (Owner policy 2026-07-13, stop-the-line: these head the fix queue, and no
  new consumer-track code is architected on the affected construct while one
  is open — see `designs/techdesign-composition-corpus.md` §1.)

### P1 — high
- **P1.1** An actively-maintained engine silently produces a wrong value —
  exit 0, no diagnostic — for code the checker accepts, and the entry does
  not dispute which behavior is correct.
- **P1.2** The only workaround is per-use: every future track touching the
  area must independently know about it and re-apply it (naming conventions,
  per-callsite guards, ...), rather than one workaround retiring the risk.

### P2 — medium
- **P2.1** Engines diverge and a semantics ruling must pick the intended
  behavior before any fix is valid (see also the cap in override 2).
- **P2.2** Performance/resource-only: output is correct on every engine, but
  asymptotic complexity or memory behavior is wrong on an
  actively-maintained engine.
- **P2.3** A documented language feature fails loud (compile-time or runtime
  error) on one actively-maintained engine while working on the others.
- **P2.4** Missing diagnostic with a correct happy path: an unsupported
  construct should error but doesn't, and no supported construct misbehaves.

### P3 — low
- **P3.1** The owner explicitly ruled it low priority (override 1).
- **P3.2** Only frozen-backend (`X64Gen`/ELF) behavior is affected.
- **P3.3** The fix already landed; only regression-test coverage is missing.
- **P3.4** Cosmetic only (formatting/spelling of output), no value or
  control-flow difference.

## #95 [P0] — atlantis routing corpus segfaults on LLVM (pre-existing at 2026-07-19 master)

**Found:** 2026-07-19, running the new `packages/atlantis/tests/runtests.sh`
across all corpus dirs during ORM Track 06 verification.
**Priority justification:** P0.3 — an actively-maintained engine (LLVM, the
primary backend) crashes mid-run on checker-accepted, previously-landed code
(the crash-later variant counts).

**Repro:**

```
./build/trident plan packages/atlantis/tests/corpus/routing --plan /tmp/r.lvplan --leviathan ./build/leviathan
./build/leviathan --build-native /tmp/r.bin --plan /tmp/r.lvplan
/tmp/r.bin        # prints 2 lines ("== M3 Era-A end-to-end ..." + "-- GET / --"), then dumps core
```

Oracle and IR runs of the same plan produce the full 40+-line expected output
(`routing.expected`). Verified present with ALL of this session's compiler
changes stashed (clean master `src/`), so it predates Track 06's work — the
routing corpus landed green on LLVM 2026-07-13 (Track 02), meaning something
since regressed it. Not diagnosed further here (out of Track 06 scope).

#91 found AND fixed 2026-07-19 (same session, owner-directed): rules and
attributes declared in a NESTED namespace (`namespace Atlantis { namespace Orm
{ … } }` or `namespace Atlantis::Orm { … }`) never fired — `uses Atlantis::Orm`
+ bare `@Table` errored `no attribute 'Table' in scope`; a fully qualified
`@Atlantis::Orm::Table` resolved the attribute but the co-located rule stayed
silent with `matched no imported rule (missing 'uses Orm'?)`; `uses Orm` (the
name the warning asked for) was `unknown namespace`. Root cause: `Rules.cpp`
keyed rule/attribute namespaces by the innermost SIMPLE name (`collectRules`/
`indexDecls` recursion dropped the prefix) while `computeFileImports` produces
full paths ("Atlantis::Orm"), and `RuleEngine::namespaceScope` could only
resolve root-level names — nested declarations fell into the gap between the
two spellings, so the visibility test `effective.count(r.ns)` could never be
true. Fixed by (1) making `namespaceScope` walk `::`-separated paths, (2)
carrying the full qualified path through the `collectRules`/`indexDecls`
recursions (with the namespace symbol resolved through the parent path, not
the global scope), and (3) building def-site qualification (§10) as a chained
Member expression (`Atlantis` then `::Orm` then `::name`) instead of a single
Name token containing "::". Regression floor:
`packages/atlantis/tests/probes/orm_p1_nested_ns_rules.lev` (oracle+IR+LLVM);
full meta/rule/expand/reify ctest set green after the fix. This unblocked the
ORM Track 06 amended-C1 placement (rules/attributes subsystem-owned in
`Atlantis::Orm`) with no fallback relocation needed.
